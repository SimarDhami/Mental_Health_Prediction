Mental Health Prediction System ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡

The Mental Health Prediction System is designed to help individuals assess their mental well-being and determine if they may need to seek professional mental health treatment. This system is based on a carefully designed prediction questionnaire, which evaluates the individual's responses and applies machine learning techniques to generate a prediction. The purpose is to support early identification and intervention for potential mental health concerns.

How It Works
1. Questionnaire:
The prediction system is based on a series of questions covering different aspects of mental health. These questions are derived from established psychological scales and validated measures used in mental health assessment.
2. Machine Learning Model:
Responses are processed using the AdaBoostClassifier algorithm. AdaBoostClassifier is a powerful machine learning technique that combines multiple weak learners (decision trees) to create a strong predictive model. It iteratively improves the accuracy of its predictions based on patterns in the data.
3. Prediction:
Once trained, the AdaBoostClassifier model predicts whether an individual may need to seek mental health treatment. The predictions are generated by feeding user responses from the questionnaire into the model.

Important Note
The predictions provided by the system are not definitive diagnoses. They serve as indicators based on patterns observed in the data. We highly recommend consulting a qualified mental health professional for a thorough evaluation and diagnosis.

Technologies Used
 Python: Core programming language for the system.
 AdaBoostClassifier: Machine learning algorithm for training and prediction.
 Flask: Web framework used to deploy the system.
 HTML/CSS/JS: Frontend technologies for building the user interface.

Privacy & Security
 We prioritize user privacy and ensure that all personal information and responses to the questionnaire are treated with the highest level of confidentiality. Data is securely stored, and we adhere to strict privacy policies in compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
